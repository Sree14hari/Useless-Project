### Project Description

VadaScope is an over-engineered AI that settles the age-old debate of what makes a perfect vada. Using a sophisticated CycleGAN model, our system analyzes an image of a vada and provides an objective, unsolicited Vada Perfection Index (VPI) score, ending family arguments one snack at a time.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Every day, millions of people consume vadas of questionable quality. The lack of a universal, quantifiable metric for vada perfection‚Äîfrom its roundness to its hole-to-vada ratio‚Äîthreatens the very fabric of our tea-time traditions. This rampant subjectivity is a recipe for culinary chaos and inconsistent snacking experiences.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Our solution is a two-stage hybrid pipeline that combines the predictive power of deep learning with the analytical precision of classical computer vision to deliver the ultimate Vada Perfection Index (VPI) score.

‚ú®Stage 1: The AI Oracle (CycleGAN)
We start by feeding a real-world vada image into a trained CycleGAN model. Acting as an AI Oracle, the model "hallucinates" idealized markings onto the input image ‚Äî essentially generating the platonic ideal of what the vada should look like.

The result? A marked image representing the Vada Perfection that could have been.

‚ú®Stage 2: The Scrutinizer (CV + VPI Calculation)
The marked image is then passed through a classical Computer Vision module, which extracts four key metrics. These metrics are used to compute the final Vada Perfection Index (VPI\<sub\>S\</sub\>) as follows:

VPI\_S = (w\_size ¬∑ S\_size + w\_shape ¬∑ S\_shape + w\_hole ¬∑ S\_hole + w\_color ¬∑ S\_color) √ó 100

üìè Metric Breakdown

| Metric               | Description                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S<sub>shape</sub>** | Measures how closely the vada's outer boundary matches a perfect circle.                                    |
| **S<sub>hole</sub>**  | Evaluates the position and roundness of the hole, comparing it with the GAN‚Äôs ideal.                        |
| **S<sub>color</sub>** | Measures deviation from the perfect golden-brown color using the **CIEDE2000** color-difference formula.     |
| **S<sub>size</sub>**  | Penalizes vadas that are too big or too small, using a Gaussian function centered on the ideal diameter.     |
